        <h1>ITIII Blog Entries</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my blog! Here's what I've been learning so far in my ITIII course:</p>

        <!-- Learning HTML -->
        <div class="blog-entry">
            <h2>HTML - Structure and Semantics</h2>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of any webpage. I've been learning how to structure web pages effectively using HTML tags such as </p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> One of the main challenges I faced with HTML was understanding the semantic elements and ensuring I’m using the correct ones for the appropriate content. But now, I’ve been practicing more and have learned how to organize content logically, improving both user experience and accessibility.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Learning CSS -->
        <div class="blog-entry">
            <h2>CSS - Styling the Web</h2>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows us to make our websites visually appealing. I’ve been learning how to style HTML elements using colors, layouts, fonts, and even responsive design. One of the most powerful features I’ve learned is how to create layouts with Flexbox and Grid, which makes designing flexible and adaptive pages a breeze!</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The most challenging part for me has been mastering Flexbox and CSS Grid. Understanding how to align and justify elements in different screen sizes took some time, but now I feel more confident using these techniques to create responsive designs.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Learning C Language -->
        <div class="blog-entry">
            <h2>C Language - Understanding Programming Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>C is a powerful programming language that helps me understand the core principles of computer science. I'm currently learning how to write simple programs that interact with data, work with loops, and handle variables. It's a great foundation for learning other languages like Python, Java, and more!</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The biggest challenge I’ve encountered with C is managing memory manually. Concepts like pointers, arrays, and memory allocation have been tricky, but I’m learning to debug efficiently and break down problems into smaller, manageable parts.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Future Learning Goals -->
        <div class="blog-entry">
            <h2>Future Learning Goals</h2>
            <p>In the coming months, I plan to dive deeper into the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mastering JavaScript, which will allow me to create interactive web applications.</li>
                <li>Learning about databases and backend technologies to create full-stack applications.</li>
                <li>Exploring UI/UX Design to enhance the user experience on websites and apps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These topics will help me become a more well-rounded developer and create both functional and visually appealing websites.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Thanks for reading about my learning journey! Stay tuned for more updates on my progress.</p>
